            <h2>Income tax</h2> <span>Definition: </span>

            <p>Tax levied by a government directly on income, especially an annual tax on personal income.</p>

            <p>An income tax is a tax that governments impose on financial income generated by all entities within their jurisdiction. By law, businesses and individuals must file an income tax return every year to determine whether they owe any taxes or are eligible for a tax refund. Income tax is a key source of funds that the government uses to fund its activities and serve the public.</p>
            <p>Most individuals do not pay tax on all of their income. Rather, the IRS offers a series of deductions, including mortgage interest, a portion of medical and dental bills, education expenses and several others, which taxpayers subtract from their gross income to determine their taxable income.</p>
