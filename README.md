# Federal-Tax-Calculator
Assignment for Interactive Web Design class @ Tidewater Community College

The purpose of this App is to act as a simple Federal Tax Calculator. This App should compute the tax liability of its user. This App will assume a simple standard deduction of $6300 for Individuals. There will be no other deductions. In addition, we will only compute the tax liability for individual persons (not head of household, or business return, etc.)
